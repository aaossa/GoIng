# GoIng - Class request platform

GoIng is a students project that allows the teaching assistants (TAs) of the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile School of Engineering to carry out classes of different courses of the program for small group of students. In this way, the TAs have an exciting opportunity to grow through practice and good treatment with students, as well as being part of a great team.

The objective of this platform is to allow the students of our engineering school to request a class of a course in different days and modules according to their preference. The platform will match students and TAs according to their time preferences, and also allow them to track the matching process following a given url.
